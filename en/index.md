## ⚔️ What is this?

This site is a small, non-exhaustive register of Excel spreadsheet revision sheets. It endeavors to list the most useful functions and explain them in such a way as to make them accessible to beginners. If it were to be developed further, it would be to aim for completeness of the functionalities offered by the software, and perhaps even to offer practical exercises with explanatory answer keys.
